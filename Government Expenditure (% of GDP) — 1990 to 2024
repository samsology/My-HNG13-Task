ver the past few days as I joined the HNG Tech 13, I completed a first full data analytics workflow using only Microsoft Excel and Power Query — from finding and cleaning real-world data to deriving insights and visualizing trends.


📊 Dataset: World Bank – Government Total Expenditure (% of GDP)
🕒 Years: 1990–2024
🌎 Scope: 196 countries (cleaned to 101 usable records)


🔍 What I Did
• Used Power Query to detect and remove missing values (>40%) and created new columns for region, development level, and economic volatility.
• Analyzed trends using Pivot Tables, Line Charts, Bar Charts, and Scatter Plots.
• Explored fiscal patterns by region and development class to see who spends more — and why.


📈 What the Charts Show
• Developed countries consistently spend a higher share of GDP on government (welfare, healthcare, and public services).
• Europe and Asia lead in average government expenditure, followed by the Americas, Africa, and Oceania.
• Most countries cluster within a narrow band, but a few show extreme spikes — likely small or resource-rich economies.
• Stable economies show higher and steadier spending patterns than volatile ones.


💡 Key Insights
1. Developed economies allocate a larger share of GDP to public spending — reflecting stronger fiscal capacity.
2. Europe and Asia dominate in average expenditure; Africa trails but shows gradual improvement.
3. Aggregating data by sums can distort patterns — averages and medians better capture typical behavior.
4. A few outlier countries/years skew totals and should be investigated individually.


🧭 Why It Matters
How much a government spends (relative to GDP) shapes its ability to fund health, education, and social protection.
Understanding these global fiscal footprints helps policymakers and analysts compare economic models — from welfare-heavy to lean-state systems.


⚙️ Tools & Skills
Excel | Power Query | Pivot Table | Data Cleaning | Visualization | Trend Analysis | Storytelling
This project reminded me that even Excel alone can reveal powerful global patterns when data is structured, cleaned, and visualized effectively.
