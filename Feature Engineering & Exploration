 MovieLens Data Analysis (HNG13 Stage 2)

## üß† Introduction
This project was completed as part of the **HNG13 Data Analytics Internship (Stage 2)**.  
The goal was to demonstrate end-to-end data analytics skills using **Python**, transitioning from spreadsheet analysis (Excel) in Stage 1 to code-driven analytics using **Google Colab** and **pandas**.

## üìÇ Dataset Overview
This dataset is a subset of the **MovieLens dataset**, containing details about movies, user ratings, and tags.  
The task required merging and analyzing multiple files connected by a common key ‚Äî `movieId`.

| File | Description | Key Columns |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| `ratings.csv` | User movie ratings | userId, movieId, rating, timestamp |
| `movies.csv` | Movie details | movieId, title, genres |
| `tags.csv` | User-generated movie tags | userId, movieId, tag, timestamp |
| `links.csv` | External identifiers | movieId, imdbId, tmdbId |

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Work Environment
- **Tool:** Google Colab  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Data Source:** Local CSV files (MovieLens subset)  
- **Output Table:** `Final_merged` ‚Üí 233,214 rows √ó 11 columns

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Merging
The datasets were cleaned and merged using **inner joins** on the `movieId` column.  
Duplicates and irrelevant fields were removed for a cleaner final dataset.

### üß© Code Snippet
```python
import pandas as pd

ratings = pd.read_csv('ratings.csv')
movies = pd.read_csv('movies.csv')
tags = pd.read_csv('tags.csv')
links = pd.read_csv('links.csv')

merged1 = pd.merge(ratings, movies, on='movieId', how='inner')
merged2 = pd.merge(merged1, tags, on='movieId', how='inner')
Final_merged = pd.merge(merged2, links, on='movieId', how='inner')

print(Final_merged.shape)  # (233214, 11)
